# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Summarizarr is an AI-powered Signal message summarizer that connects to Signal groups via WebSocket, stores messages in SQLite, and generates periodic AI summaries using multiple AI providers. Supports local AI (Ollama sidecar), cloud AI (OpenAI), and other OpenAI-compatible providers (Groq, Gemini via proxy, Claude via proxy). The application consists of a Go backend, Next.js frontend, and Signal CLI integration running as containerized services.

## Architecture

**Signal Integration**: 
- WebSocket connection to `signal-cli-rest-api` via `internal/signal/client.go`
- Only processes group messages (ignores DMs)
- Enhanced message support: quotes, reactions, and different message types

**Database Layer**: 
- SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite with schema in `schema.sql`
- Stores users, groups, messages, summaries, and authentication data
- Mandatory encryption with automatic key management
  - Production: reads key from Docker secret `/run/secrets/encryption_key`
  - Development: auto-generates key on first run and stores at `./data/encryption.key` (0600)
- Foreign key relationships and automatic migration system
- Separate auth_users table for web authentication (distinct from Signal users)
- Session storage for persistent login state
  

**AI Processing**: 
- Unified AI client in `internal/ai/client.go` with multi-provider support
- Supports local AI (Ollama sidecar) and multiple OpenAI-compatible providers
- Provider-specific configuration with sensible defaults
- Configurable scheduling via `internal/ai/scheduler.go` 
- Centralized prompt management and anonymization

**API Server**: 
- HTTP server in `internal/api/server.go` (listen address configurable via `LISTEN_ADDR`, default 8081)
- RESTful endpoints for summaries, groups, export, Signal configuration, and authentication
 - No encryption key rotation endpoint
- Session-based authentication with SQLite storage
- Protected routes using middleware for authenticated access

**Frontend**: 
- Next.js 15 application in `web/` directory with dual configuration:
  - **Development mode**: Dev server with hot reload and API proxying (port 3000)
  - **Production mode**: Static export embedded in Go backend (port 8081)
- shadcn/ui components with responsive design
- Default "Today" date filter for summaries
- Automatic API proxying from dev server to backend during local development
- Built-in authentication system with login/logout and protected routes

## Development Commands

### Local Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Initial setup
make dev-setup

# Start all services locally - non-blocking with background processes
make all          # Signal container + Go backend + Next.js frontend

# Individual services  
make signal       # Start signal-cli-rest-api container only
make backend      # Run Go backend locally with SQLCipher (blocking)
make backend-bg   # Run Go backend in background with SQLCipher and PID management
make frontend     # Run Next.js frontend with hot reload (blocking)
make frontend-bg  # Run Next.js frontend in background with API proxying

# Process management and monitoring
make status       # Check service health and URLs
make stop         # Stop all services and clean up processes
make clean        # Remove build artifacts and preserve data
```

### Service URLs
- **Frontend (Development)**: http://localhost:3000 - Next.js dev server with hot reload
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8081 - Go backend with embedded frontend
- **Signal CLI**: http://localhost:8080 - Signal WebSocket service

**Note**: Both port 3000 and 8081 serve the frontend, but port 3000 supports hot reload for development.

### Process Management
- **Background processes**: `make all` runs backend and frontend as background processes with PID files
- **Process monitoring**: PID files stored as `backend.pid` and `frontend.pid`
- **Log files**: Background processes log to `backend.log` and `frontend.log`
- **Clean shutdown**: `make stop` properly terminates all processes and cleans up PID files
- **Data preservation**: Database (`./data/`) and Signal config (`./signal-cli-config/`) preserved across restarts

### Testing
```bash
# Backend tests
go test ./...
make test-backend

# Frontend tests  
cd web && npm test
make test-frontend

# Custom testing scripts in cmd/testing/
go run cmd/testing/main.go
```

Rotation-related tests have been removed. Some backend tests still require SQLCipher to be installed and available.

### Build & Deploy
```bash
# Local Go build with SQLCipher support
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags="sqlite_crypt" -o summarizarr cmd/summarizarr/main.go

# Docker development
make docker       # Full stack with docker-compose

# Frontend build
cd web && npm run build
cd web && npm run lint
cd web && npm run type-check
```

## Configuration

All configuration uses environment variables. For local development:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Set required variables:
   - `SIGNAL_PHONE_NUMBER` (required)
   - `AI_PROVIDER` (local/openai/groq/gemini/claude)
   - Provider-specific API keys (if using cloud providers)
   - `SUMMARIZATION_INTERVAL` (e.g., 1h, 12h)

Encryption is always enabled. No encryption env vars are needed. In development, the key is created automatically at `./data/encryption.key`. In production, provide the key via a Docker secret mounted at `/run/secrets/encryption_key`.

The Makefile automatically loads `.env` for local development.

### Multi-Provider Configuration

**Provider Selection**: Use `AI_PROVIDER` to select between:
- `local`: Ollama sidecar for local AI processing
- `openai`: OpenAI cloud API 
- `groq`: Groq cloud API (native OpenAI compatibility)
- `gemini`: Google Gemini via OpenAI-compatible proxy
- `claude`: Anthropic Claude via OpenAI-compatible proxy

**Environment Variable Pattern**: Each provider uses consistent naming:
- `{PROVIDER}_API_KEY`: API key for the provider
- `{PROVIDER}_MODEL`: Model name to use
- `{PROVIDER}_BASE_URL`: API endpoint (with sensible defaults)

**Provider-Specific Defaults**: Each provider includes optimized defaults for base URLs and models.

### Mandatory SQLCipher Encryption

Database encryption is mandatory. Key management is automatic:
- Development: Key is generated on first run and stored at `./data/encryption.key` with `0600` permissions.
- Production: Supply the key via Docker secrets mounted at `/run/secrets/encryption_key`.

Note: Databases must be encrypted from the first run; no migration tool is provided to convert plaintext DBs.

**Build Requirements**: SQLCipher requires CGO and the sqlite_crypt build tag:
```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags="sqlite_crypt" cmd/summarizarr/main.go
```

#### Key Rotation

Not supported by the service. Keys are created/loaded automatically; if rotation is required, perform it offline with the service stopped and external tooling. Existing installs may contain legacy rotation tables; new installs do not create them.

## Key Go Patterns

**Modern Go 1.24+ practices**:
- Structured logging with `slog` 
- Context propagation for cancellation
- Interface segregation for testability
- Graceful shutdown with `signal.NotifyContext`

**Database interfaces**: Small, focused interfaces like:
```go
type DB interface {
    SaveMessage(msg *signal.Envelope) error
    GetMessagesForSummary(groupID int64, start, end int64) ([]MessageForSummary, error)
}
```

**Message processing flow**:
1. WebSocket → Enhanced `signal.Envelope` → Database
2. Scheduler → AI summarization with anonymization → Store summary
3. API serves summaries with name substitution

## Dependencies

- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`: SQLCipher-enabled SQLite driver (replaces modernc.org/sqlite)
- `github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai`: OpenAI API client  
- `github.com/coder/websocket`: WebSocket client for Signal
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript and shadcn/ui components
- **SQLCipher library**: Required for encryption (install via Homebrew on macOS)

## Database Schema

- **Encryption**: SQLCipher with AES-256 encryption, 256k KDF iterations, 4096-byte pages (mandatory)
- Foreign keys: messages → users/groups, summaries → groups
- Unix timestamps for all time fields
- Enhanced message fields: quotes, reactions, message types
- Automatic schema migration on startup
- **Key Management**: Automatic — dev key at `./data/encryption.key`; production key via `/run/secrets/encryption_key`
